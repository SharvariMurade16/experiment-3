# Experiment-3
## Aim -
To study and implement operators in c++
## Theory -
Operators are essential symbols used to perform various operations on variables and values in programming. They are fundamental for calculations, assignments, decision-making, logical computations, and comparisons. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key types of operators and their uses:

### Arithmetic Operators :

+: Addition (e.g., a + b)

-: Subtraction (e.g., a - b)

*: Multiplication (e.g., a * b)

/: Division (e.g., a / b)

%: Modulus (remainder, e.g., a % b)

### Assignment Operators :

=: Assigns value (e.g., x = 5)

+=: Adds and assigns (e.g., x += 5)

-=: Subtracts and assigns (e.g., x -= 5)

*=: Multiplies and assigns (e.g., x *= 5)

/=: Divides and assigns (e.g., x /= 5)

%=: Modulus and assigns (e.g., x %= 5)

### Logical Operators :

&&: AND (true if both are true, e.g., a > 5 && b < 10)

||: OR (true if at least one is true, e.g., a > 5 || b < 10)

!: NOT (inverts boolean value, e.g., !(a > 5))

^: XOR (true if exactly one is true)

### Comparison Operators :

==: Equal to (e.g., a == b)

!=: Not equal to (e.g., a != b)

>: Greater than (e.g., a > b)

<: Less than (e.g., a < b)

>=: Greater than or equal to (e.g., a >= b)

<=: Less than or equal to (e.g., a <= b)

These operators are used to perform basic calculations, make decisions, and compare values in programming.
